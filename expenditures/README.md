Expenditures is another small project to teach myself more python.
It reads my bank statements in the bankstatements folder and then attempts to categorise it into different expenditure buckets.
The goal is also to see how much I've spent per month and how much I've earned per month.

What I plan to use:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- datetime
