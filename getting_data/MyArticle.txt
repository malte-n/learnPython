After attempting to start a social business I have wanted to share my lessons learned and also the reasons why I share it in my network only after it failed.

It has been a goal of mine for a long time to start my own company. It hasn’t been the focus of my attention, but along the way I gathered more and more skills to be ready if I felt the right opportunity was there.
Last year in fall a friend asked me to help him with a business canvas for his social business idea. When we talked through his idea, I picked up on one aspect that he hadn’t mentioned before. I got so excited and ravelled about all the possibilities that he immediately asked me to join him start the company. My first reaction was an immediate - “no”. But he insisted that I think about it. I slept over it, reconsidered all the reasons why I should or shouldn’t join him ("just imagine all the work it takes to start a social business besides your full-time job…”) but it felt right and so I called him a day later to tell him that I want to be his co-founder. From then on we started weekly meetings in the evenings and meetings on the weekends.

* Focus relentlessly
    * From the get-go, we have set goals and milestones. We set a goal for the first year and derived every monthly goal, which we set every month anew, from the yearly goal. We did this every Monday morning for the coming week as well.
We used a method described in the book “The One thing”. It describes the mindset of asking yourself the question “What is the one thing you can do this week/month/year such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"
Putting it into practice on a weekly basis meant that we were always focussing our attention at reaching our goal and being aligned with our bigger ambition.

As we detailed out what our goals and visions were, the target market, GTM strategy etc. one thing was especially important to me. I wanted to make sure whatever happened to the company our friendship wouldn’t be affected.

* Set and communicate commitments and expectations
    * Everyone probably has experienced their motivations waver. Setting up working agreements right from the beginning was so helpful. First you question your own expectations, making them explicit and then having a written document that you sign makes it so much easier to stick to. The document included agreements on working hours, responsibilities, a project commitment and also a phrase coined “friendship > project”.
When it came to communicate with potential partners and customers I was faced with a challenge I hadn’t faced before.
* Selling my own vision (sales meetings/calls)
    * Standing behind your own product and pitching it in front of clients was an intimidating thought. Picking up the phone and expecting someone to pay for your product was an experience I haven’t had yet. The first call I actually wrote down a little script I could follow in case I get too nervous.
But it wasn’t just sales calls where I have had to learn to pitch my idea. The same goes for potential partners, which I thought at times was even tougher. They were freelancers and other startups we talked to for collaboration. They’ve struggled just as much as we did and it was difficult to me to ask for help without knowing beforehand how to repay the favours. Really standing behind your own product was invaluable in these times and helped me grow stronger convictions
This was probably the best lesson of them all.
* Respectful honesty especially when it’s hard
    * Starting our social business and working a day-time job was hard work. It didn’t leave much room for inner conflicts. I needed to make sure I did what I thought was right for me and for a company I wanted to work for myself. The direction for our social business became more of a topic as we realised that our first approach wouldn’t work during the economic difficulties of Covid-19. This was the most challenging time for our friendship and our company. In our discussions we sometimes poked each others moral convictions and weren’t easy to digest for either of us. We have had to get over ourselves and still respectfully address what we thought was the right direction and why. Being able to get over myself and being honest to each other made me more confident. It also made me aware how important it is to communicate openly and honestly what you believe in and respectfully accepting that someone can have totally different moral beliefs.

After some time, we realized it was better to stop working on the company, while we struggled during Covid-19 to find partnerships, than to lose the friendship. So we decided to end it and draw our conclusions.
For a few months I felt insecure about sharing my attempt to start a social business. It was mainly the fear of judgment and of admitting failure. What I can see now is how much I have been able to grow during this experience and how little it serves me to be silent about the knowledge I was allowed to gain throughout it.
It was a great decision to start a social business with a friend and the lessons I have taken away from it are invaluable. I can only encourage everyone to try it for themselves. And as for myself - I doubt this was my last attempt.
